EzAz (pronounced "EasyAyzee") is an open authorization SDK that supports XACML. It is very simple to use and extensible. It has a pluggable SPI that allows connection to virtually any policy decision point (PDP).

The idea behind EzAz is to make XACML accessible to application developers and have a simple and common API that will work with any XACML PDP. EzAz has been developed as an open initiative by several vendors in the XACML space.
